This is an Apex Legends Stat tracker module Created For Gaming YouTuber KingStevenNOS for his website where his fans can compare their live stats to his.

## Tools
**Backend** - Express JS Server
**3rd Party API** - Tracker GG API Game Tracker
**Frontend** - Vue JS

## Get Started With The Tracker
##### Clone the Repository to your Space
Upon cloning the repository to your preferred directory, you may begin to take the following steps:

1. In your preferred terminal, change directory (CD) to your project file and run:

```git
npm install

```
2. You need to create your **.env** file and enable in with variables that have been shown in the **.env.example** file. The easiest way to do so will be the copy command (**cp**) that you can use in your terminal (mostly GIT Terminal)
```git
cp .env.example .env
```

3. The repository of the client is separate from the server. So while in the directory of the terminal, clone the client repository into your project directory and relable it as client. (Mistake from my end, forgot to submodule it.)
